Improving the accuracy of a neural network model involves several strategies, including adjusting the model architecture, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing. Here are some steps you can take to increase your accuracy from 33% to a higher value, such as 98%:

Normalize Data: Ensure that your input data is properly normalized. Scaling the data to a similar range can help the neural network converge faster.

Adjust Model Architecture:

Increase the complexity of the model by adding more hidden layers or neurons.
Experiment with different activation functions. For example, try using relu in hidden layers and softmax or sigmoid in the output layer (depending on the problem type).
Learning Rate: The learning rate can significantly affect training. If you're not getting good results with a learning rate of 0.01, try reducing it to a smaller value like 0.001.

Batch Size: Experiment with different batch sizes. Smaller batch sizes can lead to faster convergence, but they might need more epochs to train effectively.

Regularization:

Add dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
Experiment with L1 and L2 regularization techniques.
Epochs: Increase the number of training epochs. However, be cautious not to overfit the model to the training data.

Optimizer: Besides Adam, try other optimizers like RMSprop or SGD with momentum.

Activation Functions: Consider using different activation functions (e.g., Leaky ReLU, Tanh) and evaluate their impact on the accuracy.

Data Augmentation: If you have limited data, consider applying data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the size of your training set.

Early Stopping: Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting. Monitor validation loss and stop training when it starts increasing.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform a systematic search for optimal hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.

Feature Engineering: Carefully select or engineer relevant features for your problem.

Inspect Data Quality: Ensure the quality of your input data. Outliers, missing values, or noisy data can impact model performance.

Debugging: Print out intermediate results like loss and accuracy during training to diagnose any issues.

More Data: If possible, acquire more data to train your model on a larger and more representative dataset.

Model Selection: Try different model architectures, including more complex ones like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), depending on your data type.

Remember, achieving high accuracy depends on the specific problem, data, and domain. Experiment with these suggestions and analyze the results to find the combination that works best for your use case.
